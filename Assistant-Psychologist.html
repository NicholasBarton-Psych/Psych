      <p>Applying for assistant psychologist roles is a daunting process. We are repeatedly told that DClinPsy and, more broadly, Psychology as a whole can be a hypercompetitive field. The first obstacle you face along this journey is getting an Assistant Psychologist position. Amongst your University cohort, percentage will be looking for assistant psychologist positions.</p>

      <p>Assistant Psychologists work directly under a Practitioner or Clinical Psychologist. This role gives one of the best insights into clinical psychology as a career. Percentage of DClinPsy applicants had had an assistant psychologist position prior to getting onto training. <em>Note: Use the clinical psychology handbook to identify other key statistics for applicants.</em></p>

      <p>I managed to receive an assistant psychologist job offer during my third year of University at the age of 20.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Here is how:</h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">1. Non-NHS Assistant Psychologist jobs is the key</h3>
      <p>NHS Assistant Psychologist roles are very difficult roles to get straight out of university, or even after one to two years as a graduate. The easiest way to obtain an AP role is to look at non-NHS roles. These roles are typically less competitive and harder for people to find. This massively increases your chance of securing a role. Look for these roles on normal job websites — Indeed, LinkedIn etc. Postings on the NHS Jobs website will always be more competitive.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">2. Get Mental Health Support Worker / Volunteering / SEN Assistant experience whilst at university</h3>
      <p>University has become largely unaffordable in recent years, leading many university students to work part-time jobs to supplement inadequate government loan funding. Students typically work hospitality roles to support themselves, but would benefit more from getting relevant experience as early on as possible. Mental Health Support Worker roles are the best in my opinion — requirements typically include having a vehicle and being able to travel to different locations across a given area.</p>
      <p>These roles are somewhat competitive and you can expect to have to apply for 5–10 before receiving an interview or job offer. Unlike assistant psychologist positions, once you have been offered an interview it is quite likely they will offer you the job if you show adequate competency.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">3. Tailor applications to the role</h3>
      <p>There is a difficult balancing game between devoting significant time to an application and sending out as many as possible. It is true that obtaining an AP role is a numbers game, but this should always be caveated with the reality that every application must be tailored to the specific role. I would recommend having a general application and spending half an hour tailoring your supporting/personal statement to the service and role you are applying for.</p>
      <p>Many applicants miss this process out, spending only 10–15 minutes tailoring applications to roles. Having a tailored application will massively help you stand out from the competition. A non-specific application is a wasted one — you are better off sending five specific applications a week than 30 non-tailored ones.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">4. Learn reflective skills</h3>
      <p>Educate yourself on what they are looking for in an Assistant Psychologist application. Sign up to this email list (link) to receive regular useful information on getting an AP role and the clinical psychology process.</p>
      <p>DClinPsy-related information online is largely anecdotal and forum-based. A lot of misinformation is spread on these websites and the psychology community can be quite protective of sharing relevant information due to the competitive nature of the field. Avoid spending too much time on Facebook pages and forums related to DClinPsy — get your information from useful and reliable sources like this website or directly from clinical psychologists and professionals in the field. Message clinical psychologists and assistant psychologists on LinkedIn asking to have a call.</p>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Key skills they will be looking for on an application:</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Reflective skills</li>
        <li>Empathy and compassion</li>
        <li>Applied psychological knowledge</li>
        <li>Formulation</li>
        <li>A logical and concisely written application</li>
      </ul>
